Wow, Redux
----------

I don't remember who I stole this original idea from, but they probably stole
it from someone before them, so we're good, right?

Wow! is not World of Warcraft. If you came here for that, you must be
feeling pretty pissed about now. Oops.

Wow! *is* a Second Language (ESL) game where the student has to guess the
meanings of a series of words or phrases without the use of body language,
native language (non-focus-language) (non-English), sound-effects, spelling or
cheating in any other way (as decided by the teacher) within a time limit.

This is a re-implementation (from a JS/HTML version I wrote in 2007) of the Wow
idea in newLISP. It's not ready for general consumption yet.
